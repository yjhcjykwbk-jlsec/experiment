When we have done the character string segmentation,
we can come back to the recognition processing about the
incorrect word which is from the optical character
recognition. The correct way is similar with the spelling
check [4]. When we get the waiting recognition character
string, we deal with it using four change which includes
exchange, delete, replace, insert. When we dispose the string
by above four methods, we use the transformational character
strings to match the word in the dictionary. When we get the
proper one, we can say the work of correcting the character
recognition by the dictionary method is well done.
The key of this method is we must use the segmented
result which gets from the Reverse Maximum Matching
algorithm [5] to do the work. The increasing of recognition
rate depends on the previous step. To begin with, we still rely
on the dictionary to match with the character string. Due to
the incorrect character string needs to be transformed, we
must contemplate which is the best transformation pattern. In
the traditional method which we deal with the English words
character string with four character transformation, the first
one is interchange characters that mean if a recognized word
consists of 5 characters, we can try to interchange the
position in every two characters from the first one to the last
one in turn If a 5 length word that can have 10 permutations
in totally and in the every interchanges we may find the
dictionary word which we want to make corrections. The
second method is to delete characters that imply we can
delete one positional character in turn until we discover the
right character string which can match with dictionary word.
The third one is the replace character that seems like
interchange, but the difference is we use other character
which may be right to instead of the character in the
pretreatment Japanese character from the first position to the
last position one by one. And when we do the work, there is
