With the development of the OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) technology, people want to have a more
intelligent method to deal with some problems in the word
recognition. Such as correct the error characters in the
processing of the recognition automatically.
The Dictionary Method gives us a way to solve such
problems and it can increase the relatively stable rate of
character recognition. This method is based mainly on the
pending recognize characters when comparing with the
dictionary library. If the comparative weight is higher than
the minimum alteration numerical value, the waiting
recognition characters are considered as the characters which
in the dictionary not based on the OCR scanning any more.
